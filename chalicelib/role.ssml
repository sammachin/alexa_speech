    The word <say-as interpret-as="characters">read</say-as> may be interpreted 
    as either the present simple form <w role="amazon:VB">read</w>, 
    or the past participle form <w role="amazon:VBD">read</w>.
    Or I could say I enjoy listening to drum and bass while fishing for bass.
    But saying ,
    I enjoy listening to drum and <w role="amazon:SENSE_1">bass</w>.
    Would be silly.
